# openftp4

This is a list of all FTP servers directly connected to port 21 in the IPv4 address space that allow anonymous logins. The login must be completed in less than 15 seconds to qualify for this list.  

The last scan contains **796,268** servers that allow anonymous access. This is **4.31486 %** of the **18,454,087** services running on port 21 in IPv4.

### Usage

1) Decompress the file

```sh
gzip -d openftp4.txt.gz
```

2) Hack away

### Format

The data follows this loose format:

```text
ip|timestamp|banner
```

- `ip` is the IPv4 address (`^([0-9.]+)\|`).
- `timestamp` is the unix timestamp of the exchange with that server (`^+?\|(\d+)\|`).
- `banner` is **everything** after the second `|` and includes the full initial banner, every response code and the full login exchange (`\|\d+\|(.+)$`).

Just a hint: If you are going to interact in any way with these servers, consider piping the list through `shuf` each time you try something new so you don't hit the same server(s) over and over again. Also, don't sort the list before rescanning, because you will encounter IP blocks that belong to one network.

If you want to be extra nice, provide your actual email address (or one you have access to) as the password (blog post for details), so server admins can contact you.

### Exclusion

(This doesn't concern FTP servers that are public by design.)

Read the blog post to learn how servers are excluded from this list. This list might be updated in the future. If you want to see your IP excluded from the list should it ever be updated, then consider fixing your access control.
